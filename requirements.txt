Backend and API Automation Testing
You are tasked with automating the testing of an API that allows CRUD operations on user accounts
(e.g., create, retrieve, update, delete a user). The API is defined using OpenAPI.
Task Requirements
Using the OpenAPI definition provided, implement automated tests for the following scenarios:
1. Create User: Test for successful creation of a user with valid data.
2. Get User by ID: Test retrieving an existing user by their ID.
3. Invalid User Creation: Ensure invalid input (e.g., missing required fields) is handled with
proper error messages.
4. Update User: Test updating user details and verify the changes.
5. Delete User: Test deleting an existing user and validate that the user is no longer
retrievable.
6. Edge Cases: Handle cases like trying to retrieve, update, or delete a non-existing user.
Use any automation framework and language you prefer. At Mintos we use PHP with CodeCeption
for writing the API tests and Cucumber for writing BDD-style tests in our Java projects.
Bonus (Optional)
1. Add tests for performance, security (e.g., checking unauthorized access).
2. Write data-driven tests that validate different input combinations.
3. Containerization for setup
Evaluation criteria
1. Feature-completeness
2. Code quality, structure
3. Ease of setup
Please send the code as a link to a repository on some public VCS service (e.g., GitHub) and
instructions on how to set it up once completed.
